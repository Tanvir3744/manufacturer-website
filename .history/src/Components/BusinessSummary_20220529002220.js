                            competitive costs to compete effectively in the global economy. Many studies undertaken in recent years to
                            define the most important areas of industrial research have emphasized the need to place manufacturing process
                            development on an equal basis with new product technologies for cars. According to these studies, our company
                            must establish a preeminent foundation in car's spare parts manufacturing, which is capable of innovating and
                            improving not only products but manufacturing processes.
